<p><em>&hellip;In that Empire, the Art of Cartography attained such Perfection that the map of a single Province occupied the entirety of a City, and the map of the Empire, the entirety of a Province. In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guilds struck a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, and which coincided point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography as their Forebears had been, saw that that vast Map was Useless, and not without some Pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the Inclemencies of Sun and Winters. In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.</em></p>

<p>This paper examines New York City&rsquo;s Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP). SYEP provides jobs to youth ages 14-24, and due to high demand for summer jobs, allocates slots through a random lottery system. We match student-level data from the SYEP program with educational records from the NYC Department of Education and use the random lottery to estimate the effects of SYEP participation on a number of academic outcomes, including test taking and performance. We find that SYEP participation has positive impacts on student academic outcomes, and these effects are particularly large for students who participate in SYEP multiple times.</p>

		<p><h2 id="human-capital-and-college-prospects">Human Capital and College Prospects</h2>
<p>This paper studies how parental investment in the human capital of children responds to changes 
in the college environment the child will face in late adolescence. I develop and estimate a dynamic
model of parental savings and investment in which parents make a trade-off between saving in financial 
assets or the human capital of their child. Parents care about their asset position at the end of the 
finite decision problem as well as the quality of college their child enjoys. College quality is produced 
by combining tuition dollars, a choice made by the parent, and the human capital of the child in the 
terminal period. These inputs are complementary, so policies that increase tuition spending on the child 
will increase the return to investing in one&rsquo;s child during childhood. I simulate three counterfactual 
education policies: an unconditional transfer, a conditional tuition grant, and a policy that approximates 
free public university. I find that such policies increase human capital investment the most in children 
from poor families, but the magnitudes of the increases are modest.</p>

<p>We consider how intra-family insurance affects household portfolio choices and savings decisions. Empirically, 
we find that stock market participation and the fraction of assets invested in stocks are increasing in measures 
of family member human capital. Taking this as suggestive evidence that intra-family insurance reduces risk aversion, 
we study a model of consumption, savings, and portfolio choice with two-sided altruism and no commitment in which 
parents and children can insure each other. In the model, agents with family members of lower human capital optimally 
choose to hold lower portfolio weights, reducing the average rate of return obtained. Families with lower human capital 
thus not only have lower labor income, but also lower rates of return, potentially propagating both the level and 
persistence in wealth inequality.</p>

		<p><h2 id="skills-savings-and-the-family">Skills, Savings, and the Family</h2>
<p>I consider how intra-family insurance between prime-age adults and their elderly parents 
affects incentives to invest in the human capital of children. I document gradients in 
skills and measures of investment in child human capital with respect to
grandparent wealth and health, even accounting for parent resources. Interpreting this
as suggesting evidence that grandparent resources shift savings and investment incentives
for parents, I jointly model the production of child skills and the consumption-savings
of parents and grandparents in an environment with income, health, and expenditure
risk and altruistic links but no commitment. I show that such a model provides sharp
predictions regarding the importance of intra-family insurance relative to bequests in
shifting parental incentives across the lifecycle. A calibrated version of the model is
able to qualitatively reproduce the investment gradients present in the data.</p>

<p>We study United States economic growth at the state level over the period from 1970-2015. 
Our main contribution is the construction of new data series on capital at the state and industry level, 
using data on the aggregate capital stock and payments to capital at the state and industry level. 
We use published data and neoclassical theory to construct this data, as there are no official data 
on investment or capital at the state level. We use this data to study capital accumulation and 
convergence across states, as well as levels and trends in factor shares across states, regions, and industries. 
We show that the decline in labor&rsquo;s share of income was strongest in states where it was initially the highest, 
and while labor&rsquo;s share fell in manufacturing it increased in services. Thus even as manufacturing shrank and 
services grew as a share of total output, labor&rsquo;s share declined overall. We then adopt a standard growth 
accounting framework to investigate whether state growth during this period was due to capital accumulation, 
a growing workforce, or total factor productivity growth. We find substantial heterogeneity in the growth 
experiences of states. States with higher average output growth also had higher average productivity growth, 
but a larger fraction of their growth was driven by factor accumulation. In addition, we decompose state 
TFP growth into a component that captures growth within industries and one that characterizes productivity 
growth due to factor reallocation towards more productive industries. We find that for most states, growth 
is due to within-industry productivity growth as opposed to reallocation across industries, and in fact 
reallocation effects generally slowed growth.</p>
