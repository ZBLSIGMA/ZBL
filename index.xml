      <description>Human Capital and College Prospects This paper studies how parental investment in the human capital of children responds to changes in the college environment the child will face in late adolescence. I develop and estimate a dynamic model of parental savings and investment in which parents make a trade-off between saving in financial assets or the human capital of their child. Parents care about their asset position at the end of the finite decision problem as well as the quality of college their child enjoys. College quality is produced by combining tuition dollars, a choice made by the parent, and the human capital of the child in the terminal period. These inputs are complementary, so policies that increase tuition spending on the child will increase the return to investing in one&amp;rsquo;s child during childhood. I simulate three counterfactual education policies: an unconditional transfer, a conditional tuition grant, and a policy that approximates free public university.</description>

      <description>Intra-family Insurance, Portfolio Choice, and Inter-generational Wealth Inequality with Eirik Brandsaas We consider how intra-family insurance affects household portfolio choices and savings decisions. Empirically, we find that stock market participation and the fraction of assets invested in stocks are increasing in measures of family member human capital. Taking this as suggestive evidence that intra-family insurance reduces risk aversion, we study a model of consumption, savings, and portfolio choice with two-sided altruism and no commitment in which parents and children can insure each other. In the model, agents with family members of lower human capital optimally choose to hold lower portfolio weights, reducing the average rate of return obtained. Families with lower human capital thus not only have lower labor income, but also lower rates of return, potentially propagating both the level and persistence in wealth inequality.</description>

      <description>Making Summer Matter: The Impact of Youth Employment on Academic Performance with Amy Ellen Schwartz, Jacob Leos-Urbel, and Matthew Wiswall NBER Working Paper No. 21470
This paper examines New York City&amp;rsquo;s Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP). SYEP provides jobs to youth ages 14-24, and due to high demand for summer jobs, allocates slots through a random lottery system. We match student-level data from the SYEP program with educational records from the NYC Department of Education and use the random lottery to estimate the effects of SYEP participation on a number of academic outcomes, including test taking and performance. We find that SYEP participation has positive impacts on student academic outcomes, and these effects are particularly large for students who participate in SYEP multiple times.</description>

      <description>Skills, Savings, and the Family I consider how intra-family insurance between prime-age adults and their elderly parents affects incentives to invest in the human capital of children. I document gradients in skills and measures of investment in child human capital with respect to grandparent wealth and health, even accounting for parent resources. Interpreting this as suggesting evidence that grandparent resources shift savings and investment incentives for parents, I jointly model the production of child skills and the consumption-savings of parents and grandparents in an environment with income, health, and expenditure risk and altruistic links but no commitment. I show that such a model provides sharp predictions regarding the importance of intra-family insurance relative to bequests in shifting parental incentives across the lifecycle. A calibrated version of the model is able to qualitatively reproduce the investment gradients present in the data.</description>

      <description>Capital and Productivity in US States with Noah Williams We study United States economic growth at the state level over the period from 1970-2015. Our main contribution is the construction of new data series on capital at the state and industry level, using data on the aggregate capital stock and payments to capital at the state and industry level. We use published data and neoclassical theory to construct this data, as there are no official data on investment or capital at the state level. We use this data to study capital accumulation and convergence across states, as well as levels and trends in factor shares across states, regions, and industries. We show that the decline in labor&amp;rsquo;s share of income was strongest in states where it was initially the highest, and while labor&amp;rsquo;s share fell in manufacturing it increased in services. Thus even as manufacturing shrank and services grew as a share of total output, labor&amp;rsquo;s share declined overall.</description>
